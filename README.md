# llm_router_services

## ✨ Overview

`llm_router_services` provides **HTTP services** that implement the core functionality used by the LLM‑Router’s plugin
system.  
The services expose guardrail and masking capabilities through Flask applications
that can be called by the corresponding plugins in `llm_router_plugins`.

Key components:

| Sub‑package              | Primary purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **guardrails/**          | Hosts the NASK‑PIB guardrail service (`nask_pib_guard_app.py`). It receives a JSON payload, chunks the text, runs a Hugging‑Face classification pipeline, and returns a safety verdict (`safe` flag + detailed per‑chunk results). |
| **maskers/**             | Contains the **BANonymizer** (`banonymizer.py`) – a lightweight Flask service that performs token‑classification based anonymisation of input text.                                                                                |
| **run_*.sh** scripts     | Convenience wrappers to start the services (Gunicorn for the guardrail, plain Flask for the anonymiser).                                                                                                                           |
| **requirements‑gpu.txt** | Lists heavy dependencies (e.g., `transformers`) required for GPU‑accelerated inference.                                                                                                                                            |

The services are **stateless**; they load their models once at start‑up and then serve requests over HTTP.
